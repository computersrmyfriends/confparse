Several tasks can be planned depending on how useful it is felt

  * add a new attribute properties instance for the default, recursively
  * plan errors and throw useful exceptions instead of empty strings
  * match closely the standard !ConfigParser
  * package it for the main distrib, lobby for its inclusion into the next python
  * add new classes each of them adapted to the common Unix files (apache, samba, hosts, syslog ...)
